Drug -Drug interactions
 Hydrochlorothiazide + Empagliflozin   

Sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2 inhibitors and thiazide diuretics combined increase the diuretic effects, causing an electrolyte imbalance in the patient. Nonetheless, it is more common with loop diuretics. It would Increase the urinary sodium excretion. And increase urine output. Monitor for signs of toxicity â€“ e.g. Hypotension or renal impairment . 

Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide  + Sitagliptin 
 monitor for signs and symptoms of angioedema. 





Irbesartan Hydrochlorothiazide + Metformin 

Thiazide diuretics can reduce the hypoglycemic effects of metformin. It could minimise insulin secretion and cause hypokalaemia. Potassium depletion causes glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion.  Thiazide diuretics cause Hypokalemia and lack of body potassium. Blood Glucose Levelss should be monitored frequently to assess worsening diabetic control. 






Rabeprazole + Metformin  
Concomitant administration of PPIs with Metformin significantly increases plasma metformin . Because Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) may inhibit organic cation transporters (OCTs), resulting in increased serum levels of metformin (a substrate of OCT).
