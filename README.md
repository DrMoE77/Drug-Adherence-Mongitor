  ## Usage
  As a doctor I want to be able to track my patients' medication adehrence as this will affect my judgment as to wether to increase a paticular dose or wehter the patient has been non-complient and I do not unnecessarily need to increase their dose. As the patient I want to be able to see if my medications have serios interactions and be alerted to when my dose is due. Additionally I want to be abke to see if my prescribed meds will interact with my OTC meds.
